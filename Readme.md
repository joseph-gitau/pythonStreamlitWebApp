The topic would be crypto and you can design however just meet all requirements. you can chooce any api from the link provided



Preliminaries

A web application is an interactive computer program developed using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), which stores (Database, Files) and manipulates data (CRUD - create, read, update and delete). Webapps can be used by a team or single user to perform tasks over the internet.

The goal of this project is to apply the Usability Goals and Design Principles learned in class into the development of a web application using Streamlit. Your project needs to manipulate data requested through an API. The format of the documents received can be of any type, but I highly recommend JSON, XML, or CSV. Here is a list of possible APIs that might be of interest to you:

Choose APIs that collect data that is of interest to you so that the development of the Web Application becomes more pleasant.

Requirements

The web application needs to be developed using Python programming languages version 3 (3.9 or 3.10 recommended) and the open-source framework Streamlit. Your objective is to create a web application that manipulates data and displays information to the users in the form of:

At least 1 interactive table (https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/da... to an external site.)

At least 2 chart elements, such as line, area or bar charts (matplotlib is allowed). To display:

a line chart - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/ch... to an external site.

an area chart - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/ch... to an external site.

a bar chart - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/ch... to an external site.

At least 1 map with points marked on it (a simple map can be created using https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/ch... to an external site. or a more complex 3d map at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/ch... to an external site.)

At least 1 button widget (https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.button)

At least 1 checkbox widget (https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.checkbox)

At least 2 of the essential feedback and messages boxes to the users:

Success box - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/st... to an external site.

Information box - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/st... to an external site.

Error box - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/st... to an external site.

Exception message (optional) - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/st... to an external site.

At least any 5 different widgets chosen from the following:

Radio button - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/wi... to an external site.

Selectbox - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/wi... to an external site.

Date input - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/wi... to an external site.

Time input - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/wi... to an external site.

File uploader - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/wi... to an external site.

Color - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/wi... to an external site.

You may include a progress bar for certain components of your application; however, this is not mandatory

You may include media elements such as image, audio or video, which are not a requirement but can add to the overall harmony of the web application being developed

The biggest HCI challenges will be the selection of appropriate layouts and containers. For example, you will need to study your target audience and the data being manipulated to decide, for example, whether to have 3 columns or 1 single column, or even whether an input data should be entered as a radio button or a text field, or whether to display a certain data output as a line chart or a map. Ask yourselves throughout the development process some of these questions:

What do the users expect to find or do on this web app?

What are my users trying to accomplish?

Is this web appâ€™s primary aim to inform, to sell, or to amuse?

What competitor apps, if any, exist, and how should this app be inspired by/different than, those competitors?

What kind of experiences do my users find appealing and rewarding?

How can my productâ€™s functions be most effectively organized? List Usability Goals and Design Principles utilized in the interface design.

How will my product introduce itself to first-time users?

How can my product put an understandable, appealing, and controllable face on technology?

How can my product deal with problems that users encounter?

How will my product help infrequent and inexperienced users understand how to accomplish their goals?

How can my product provide sufficient depth and power for expert users?

Streamlit allows you to display a sidebar, insert containers laid out as side-by-side columns, insert a multi-element container that can be expanded/collapsed, among many other features:

Sidebar - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/la... to an external site.

Columns - https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/la... to an external site.

Initial Steps

Choose a topic of interest to you (examples: sports, geology, music, cryptocurrency, farming, etc.)

Search for free and public datasets or free public APIs where you can request data to be manipulated and visualized in your web application

Start developing your web application:

Download and install Python programming language version 3

Download and Install PyCharm IDE Professional version by applying for a student license using your FIU email

Create a new Python project in PyCharm IDE and:

Install the necessary packages: pip install streamlit numpy pandas

Import the above packages:

import streamlit as st

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

Include the components listed in REQUIREMENTS according to the goal of your web application and to the type of data being manipulated.

Distribute text elements in the form of title, header, subheader, caption or pre-formatted text across the web application so that the content of your web app engages readers and drives them to taken the necessary actions to fulfill your appsâ€™s goals. Avoid dull, lifeless, and overlong prose. Try keeping text short and intriguing. This will encourage users to click through to other elements. Group content into cohesive categories by breaking it up into short paragraphs enriched with visual elements. This can help you make your web app have a light and engaging feel.

You are ready to submit it!

Donâ€™t worry. I know this was so much fun. But this is not the end of this project. You will need it for our final and, arguably the most important branch of HCI, project, the Usability Test Project.
